This lab is divided into two parts:

1. Instructions Pt. 1: Writing
2. Instructions Pt. 2: Reviewing

#### Instructions Pt. 1: Writing

The writing section in divided into four required sections and one optional section.

##### Mandatory Sections

1. 3 technical things I know now that I did not know before
2. 3 things I would do differently
3. 3 things that were unexpected
4. 3 things that went well

##### Optional Sections

1. 3 things that went poorly

##### All Sections

For every section, make sure that you arrange your answers in the following format:

```
1. How to incorporate the pagination gem so that an index page only displays 20 items at a time
2. How to add hidden fields to a form so that the logic in the controller that associates one new model with another can be refactored into one line
3. Something else...
```

## Instructions Pt. 2: Review

On Tuesday morning, take a look at a fellow student's pull request. Read what they wrote for this assignment and respond to it by making a comment on their pull request. 

Should you notice any spelling, grammatical, or structure errors, let them know as well, though this should be treated as more of an afterthought than the focus of your comment.
