1. Having less numbers of jobs being listed on a page, our index page was overpopulated by a lot of data.
2. Communication and working in the team should be more delibrate, responsive and open minded.
3. Make things simpler and usually it becomes too simple. Good to have goup mates to remind me about making it more interesting.
